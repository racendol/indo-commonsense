# Indonesian Commonsense Reasoning Model Using Intermediate Task, Cross-lingual Transfer Learning, and Task Recasting Approach

This repository stores all source codes for my undergraduate thesis research: Indonesian Commonsense Reasoning Model Using Intermediate Task, Cross-lingual Transfer Learning, and Task Recasting Approach. 

Most of the code in experiment notebook is gone because of server wipe, so it doesn't have the origial output that are used in the paper.

For now this repository only contains the code for the general template for training and dataset creations.
